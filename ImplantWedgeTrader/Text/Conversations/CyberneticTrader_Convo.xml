      <text>Greetings, traveler. I deal in cybernetic implants and credit wedges. I can convert your old cybernetics into hard currency - the rarer the implant, the more wedges you'll receive. Got any old tech you'd like to convert?</text>

      <text>I pay based on the complexity and rarity of the implant. Basic implants get you 1 credit wedge, advanced ones get 2, and the truly exotic pieces can fetch 3 wedges. Each implant can only be traded once - I keep records, you understand.</text>
