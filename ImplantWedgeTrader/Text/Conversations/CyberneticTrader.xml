      <text>"I specialize in cybernetic implants and augmentations. I can convert your old or unwanted implants into credit wedges - a more liquid form of currency. My rates are fair: basic implants fetch 1 credit wedge, advanced ones 2 wedges, and the most sophisticated can earn you 3 wedges."

"I only deal in implant conversion - I don't sell items through traditional commerce. My expertise is in evaluating and liquidating cybernetic assets."</text>

      <text>The trader's augmented eyes dim slightly. "Safe travels, and remember - I'm always here if you need to liquidate your cybernetic assets."</text>
